            In this task, you will see short videos of a ball rolling into a tube, viewed from the top (above the tube). Your task is to catch the ball as soon as possible after it exits the tube, by clicking it with your mouse cursor.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tubes have several openings. Inside the tube there can be blockings, which prevent the ball from continuing its path, meaning you wonâ€™t know in advance which opening it will come out of.
        </p>

        <p>
            After you click the mouse in each trial, you can move to the next trial by pressing the space bar. If you need to take a short break, wait before pressing the space bar.
        </p>

        <p>
            Try to be as fast and as accurate as possible.
        </p>

        <p>
            Good luck!
        </p>
